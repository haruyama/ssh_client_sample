* SSH Client Sample

This is a SSH Client but not a practical SSH Client.
I suppose that this helps us understand SSH Protocol.

I confirm that this works for Debian sid's sshd "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_5.8p1 Debian-4".

Ex: login sshd(localhost:22) using 'test' user (with password 'password')  and execute 'ls'.

You can run on sbt.

Or you can generate a jar and run java command.
